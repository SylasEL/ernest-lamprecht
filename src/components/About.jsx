                        Hail and well met, traveler! I am Ernest, a fledgling wizard in the arcane arts of software engineering, freshly initiated from the venerable halls of Stellenbosch University. With my enchanted keyboard and a spellbook of programming languages, I traverse the realms of digital creation, weaving spells of JavaScript and conjuring responsive designs that transcend the ordinary. Each project is a saga, every line of code a rune inscribed with purpose, striving to shape the fabric of the digital multiverse into realms of wonder and possibility. Though I stand at the dawn of my journey, my ambition burns brighter than a phoenixâ€™s flame, ready to carve my legend into the stars of the digital cosmos.
